task1.java - ATM INTERFACE
-----------------------------------

To ensure a secure and efficient account management system, I developed a console-based ATM interface that allows users to authenticate themselves by entering their username and PIN. To store user information, such as transaction history, balance, username, and PIN, I used a JDBC connection to a SQL database. This enables us to manage user data in a centralized and secure manner.

The ATM interface offers a range of useful features, including registration, login, withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, transfer, and transaction history.
These features are designed to provide users with a comprehensive banking experience, enabling them to perform various transactions and keep track of their finances from the comfort of their own device

task2.java - NUMBER GUESSING GAME
--------------------------------------

As part of my programming assignment for Oasis Infobyte, I created a Java-based game that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range of 1-100. The game allows players five attempts to guess the number correctly and displays their score after they have either completed all their attempts or correctly guessed the number. It's a fun and interactive way to test one's logical thinking skills, while also demonstrating proficiency in Java programming.
